The paper results  shown at figures 08 and 09 corresponds to the following log files:

_logi_1000_NJ_s50.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s50.json for the first round to 

_logi_1000_NJ_s90.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s90.json for the fifth round. 

The structure of a log file is explained as follow:

-The number 1000 represents the number of time slices reported at the log.

-NJ, i.e. not Juggling: reflect that the approach to update weights at runtime (ARRoW) was not applied. 

-YJ, i.e.Yes Juggling: reflect that the approach to update weights at runtime (ARRoW) was applied. 

-s[number], e.g. s50, represents the applied seed number (i.e., 50).

Additional experiments were performed and we obtained equivalent results to the reported at the paper. Details can be observed at the following paired log files:

_logi_1000_NJ_s150.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s150.json

_logi_1000_NJ_s160.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s160.json

_logi_1000_NJ_s170.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s170.json

_logi_1000_NJ_s180.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s180.json

_logi_1000_NJ_s190.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s190.json


_logi_1000_NJ_s350.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s350.json

_logi_1000_NJ_s360.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s360.json

_logi_1000_NJ_s370.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s370.json

_logi_1000_NJ_s380.json and _logi_1000_YJ_s380.json
